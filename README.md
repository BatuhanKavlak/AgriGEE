# AgriGEE
These are some agricultural analyses I performed on GEE.

I'll add scripts for calculating NDVI, VHI, and etc. Please warn me if any calculation is wrong. 

## Scripts:
[Vegetation Health Index](https://code.earthengine.google.com/2c8138b29187b6c3e732708ae600edaa): Calculated with MODIS and Sentinel2.

More will come hopefully.
